# WARDIA - Legacy of Trees
Online Game Design project for UNIMI Course 2020/21.

"Compete with other players to decide the fate of nature!"

#### THIS IS A GAME PROTOTYPE - This must not be intended as the final version of the game.


## Introduction
In an alternate 1800, during an industrial revolution in a land called Wardia, deforestation reached a no turning point. Nature was devastated by men and industry and the few wizards that lived among humans splitted into two factions: black and white ones. Black wizards chose to serve the industry and became leaders of large corporations, encouraging the final devastation of nature. White wizards remained in the forests of Wardia and are still protecting nature and animals. Because of this strong opposition the two sides will battle against each other into violent clashes between machines and nature, to preserve or to destroy the last forests remaining in the world.

## Description (of the game)

WARDIA: Legacy of Trees is a turn-based strategy game in which players will engage in 1v1 multiplayer battles. 
The game is set on a board based on hexagonal tiles in which some units can be placed from a roster created by the player: the aim and the winning condition is to conquer all the trees spawned on the board before the opponent. 
Every unit is unique, has its abilities (attack, health and movement)  and a cost (in Nature Points): the black side has machine-type units; the white side has nature-based units. The side is decided at the beginning of the game randomly. Every turn players acquire Nature Points (2 per turn + 1 per conquered Tree): these points can be spent to place units or buildings. Units in particular can be spawned only in cells with a conquered tree, at the start of the allied side, on buildings or in the surrounding of special units. Every turn units move forward based on their movement capacity, they can engage in fights against enemy units and buildings or conquer other trees. If a unit reaches the end of the board it will be teleported to the start of the allied side and will continue proceeding forward next turn. 
The game ends when one of the players has conquered all the trees or the turn 20 has been reached: in this case the player with most trees wins or the one with most nature points (in case of the same amount of trees).
Key features
The aim of the game is not to reach the opponent (Stormbound) or to defeat him (Clash Royale) but is to conquer and protect all the trees on the board. How many trees you control and how many nature points you have is the key feature to gain an advantage over the opponent.
